## A little about my education and the work I've done
- I enrolled in my local community college's Software QA Testing program after years of doing different jobs, without actually advancing into roles that I felt genuinely passionate about.
- With a little encouragement from my partner, I finally decided to pursue a subject that I felt I would excel with, given the proper training.
- During my coursework, I learned industry-standard workflows in Software QA from highly-skilled instructors with long-time professional experience in the software industry.
- Manual and automated testing workflows, with lessons covering front-to-back SDLC/STLC, Documentation processess and technical writing exercises for all project phases
- HTML/CSS Web Design
- Web functionality and usability testing, non-functional testing projects
- Over 1,000 test cases written and executed across a few major testing projects
- Selenium IDE test automation suites
- C# Programming with .NET framework, MSTest Unit Testing
- MSSQL and SQL Server Database management
- JIRA, TestCollab & Manual project management processes

### Why I'm here
- My current goal is to begin a career in Software QA testing (in any sector, really)
- Continued growth and learning, expanding and refining my skillset
- Narrow down what exactly I excel at, leading to career advancement
